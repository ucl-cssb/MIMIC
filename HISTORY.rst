* First release on PyPI. 


The MIMIC package can be used to simulate microbial system data using a generalized Lotka-Volterra model (gMLV) or using vector autoregression (VAR) and multivariate vector autoregression (MVAR).
Additionaly, it can perform interaction inference using the VAR and MVAR models, and gaussian processes.

The package is based on the work of [1] and [2].
