# Define package version
__version__ = '0.1.0'

# You can also include any global package initialization here

# Define the __all__ variable
__all__ = ['VARsim', 'gMLV_sim']
# This will allow you to use the following import statement:
# from mimic import VARsim, gMLV_sim
# instead of:
# from mimic.model_VAR.sim import VARsim
# from mimic.gMLV.gMLV_sim import *
