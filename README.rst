Overview

MIMIC: A Comprehensive Python Package for Simulating, Inferring, and Predicting 
Microbial Community Interactions

The study of microbial communities is vital for understanding their impact on 
environmental, health, and technological domains. The *Modelling and Inference of 
MICrobiomes Project* (MIMIC) introduces a Python package designed to advance the 
simulation, inference, and prediction of microbial community interactions and dynamics. 
Addressing the complex nature of microbial ecosystems, MIMIC integrates a suite of 
mathematical models, including previously used approaches such as *Generalized Lotka-
Volterra* (gLV), *Gaussian Processes* (GP), and *Vector Autoregression* (VAR), plus 
newly developed models for integrating multiomic data, to offer a comprehensive 
framework for analysing microbial dynamics. By leveraging Bayesian inference and 
machine learning techniques, MIMIC accurately infers the dynamics of microbial 
communities from empirical data, facilitating a deeper understanding of their complex 
biological processes, unveiling possible unknown ecological interactions, and enabling 
the design of microbial communities. Such insights could help to advance microbial 
ecology research, optimizing biotechnological applications, and contributing to 
environmental sustainability and public health strategies. MIMIC is designed for 
flexibility and ease of use, aiming to support researchers and practitioners in 
microbial ecology and microbiome research. This software package contributes to 
microbial ecology research and supports ecological predictions and applications, 
benefiting the scientific and applied microbiology communities.

Installation
--------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Conda Package Manager**: We recommend using Conda to manage the environment due to dependencies that may not be available via pip.

Installation Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For macOS and Ubuntu
""""""""""""""""""""

1. **Clone the Repository**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ucl-cssb/MIMIC.git
      cd MIMIC

2. **Create the Conda Environment**

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda env create -f environment.yml

3. **Activate the Environment**

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate mimic_env

4. **Install the Package**

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

5. **Run the Code**

   Refer to the `Usage`_ section below for instructions on how to run the code.

For Windows
"""""""""""

1. **Clone the Repository**

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ucl-cssb/MIMIC.git
      cd MIMIC

2. **Create the Conda Environment for Windows**

   On Windows, use the `environment_windows.yml` file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda env create -f environment_windows.yml

3. **Activate the Environment**

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate mimic_env

4. **Install the Package**

   Install the package in editable mode:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

5. **Run the Code**

   Refer to the `Usage`_ section below for instructions on how to run the code.

Alternative Installation Using Pip Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you prefer to use pip without Conda, you can install the package and its dependencies by compiling `requirements.in` into `requirements.txt`:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Step 1: Compile requirements.txt from requirements.in
   pip install pip-tools
   pip-compile requirements.in

   # Step 2: Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .


**Note**: This method may not install all dependencies correctly, especially if there are packages that are only available via Conda. We recommend using the Conda installation method for full functionality.

Compilers
"""""""""""
A g++ compiler is required for the PyMC3 package.
