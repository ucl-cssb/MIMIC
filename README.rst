MIMIC: A Comprehensive Python Package for Simulating, Inferring, and Predicting 
Microbial Community Interactions

The study of microbial communities is vital for understanding their impact on 
environmental, health, and technological domains. The *Modelling and Inference of 
MICrobiomes Project* (MIMIC) introduces a Python package designed to advance the 
simulation, inference, and prediction of microbial community interactions and dynamics. 
Addressing the complex nature of microbial ecosystems, MIMIC integrates a suite of 
mathematical models, including previously used approaches such as *Generalized Lotka-
Volterra* (gLV), *Gaussian Processes* (GP), and *Vector Autoregression* (VAR) plus 
newly developed models for integrating multiomic data, to offer a comprehensive 
framework for analysing microbial dynamics. By leveraging Bayesian inference and 
machine learning techniques, MIMIC accurately infers the dynamics of microbial 
communities from empirical data, facilitating a deeper understanding of their complex 
biological processes, unveiling possible unknown ecological interactions, and enabling 
the design of microbial communities. Such insights could help to advance microbial 
ecology research, optimizing biotechnological applications, and contributing to 
environmental sustainability and public health strategies. MIMIC is designed for 
flexibility and ease of use, aiming to support researchers and practitioners in 
microbial ecology and microbiome research. This software package contributes to 
microbial ecology research and supports ecological predictions and applications, 
benefiting the scientific and applied microbiology communities.

Installation
--------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Conda package manager is recommended due to dependencies on PyMC

* Sckit-learn
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy
* PyMC


Steps
^^^^^

#. Clone the repository.
#. Create a new conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.
#. Activate the new environment.
#. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of the repository.
#. Install the package using `pip install -e .` from the root directory of the repository.
#. Run the code using the instructions below.
#. Deactivate the environment when finished.

Usage
-------

Running gLV Model Simulations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 run_gLV.py <output directory> <number to simulate> <number of species> <number of time points> <number of replicates> <number of time points to fit> <number of replicates to fit> <number of time points to predict> <number of replicates to predict>

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    python run_gLV.py "C:\Users\User\Desktop\test_gLV" 100 10 100 10 50 5 50 5
